Features: 

Navigation: We have a navigation bar implemented on the top of each page to allow the user to switch between the websites of our pages

ChatBox: We've included a chatbox that acts as a live server chatroom where our users can chat with a healthcare professional. The chatbox is featured on the bottom of each page. When logged into an account, the chatbox will use the user's first name to keep track of what they type. We've also included a feature where you can 'whisper' a message to someone if multiple people are in the live chat, and the message will only show up for the person you whispered it to.

Page Descriptions:

Landing Page:
We've designed an aestetic yet simple homepage that our users would land on when visiting our application. We've included a small summary of what HealthHub+ is. We've included another navigation tool alongside our navbar that gives the user a small description of what each page is for. You can use this to travel to each page by clicking the page name under the description. We have a carousel of testimonals from users of our application.

Symptom Checker:
Our symptom checker works with an API (medicAPI) to provide users with a list of diagnoses' based on their symptoms. There is a text input box where the user can type in the symptoms they're experiencing, and we've utilized a dropdown menu so when the user types the list of possible symptoms aligns with what's currently typed. You can add multple symptoms by clicking the 'Add Symptom' button. Before clicking our 'Get Diagnosis' button, the user must enter their sex, as well as birth year for more accurate results. Once the input is filled in and the 'Get Diagnosis' button is pressed, the application will return with a list of diagnosis as well as the potential accuracy. Under this section, we have three cards that provide resources regarding Vaccinations, STD Testing, and Dental Care.

Remedies:
Our remedies page provides users with at-home and over-the-counter remedies, as well as additional resources/advice. If the symptom checker is used first, our application will take the first diagnosis listed and enter it into the 'Enter Diagnosis' input box, or the user can enter a different diagnosis. We've also utilized a dropdown bar here that filters the possible diagnosis' that can be entered. We've created an API that scans information from the internet and provides a description of your diagnosis, recommended remedies, and alternative treatment options. Under this section, we've utilized a carousel with general tips for good health practices. To use the carousel, you'd simply click on the faded card to the right or left to see the next or previous card.


Mental Health:
Our mental health page utilizes an API we created that includes the top thirty feelings or emotions that cause people to seek mental health support or therapy, along with three pieces of advice matched with each emotion. The user is prompted to enter an emotion in the input box under the question "How are you feeling?". The user will then be returned with whichever three tips are associated with the emotion they've entered. Under this section, we have additional mental health resources, including a crisis hotline, a warmline, and an online mental health screening/diagnosis test.

Login:
Our login page allows our users to sign up for an account as well as login to a previous account. When creating an account, we have a security question to ensure better security for our user's account. We've implemented a forgot password feature that allows the user to change their password. When logged in, we created a history of all the diagnosis' the user has recieved from our application in the past, which the user can access.
